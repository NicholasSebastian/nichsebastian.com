Soon to be the latest and greatest version of my personal website, made with Gatsby.js.  
I use this site for whatever really, like posting blogs and showcasing my projects maybe.

## Technologies Used

1.  **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Obviously.

2.  **React.js**: Best frontend JavaScript framework, makes my life easier.

3.  **Gatsby.js**: Framework built on top of React. Generates static files from React templates so the website at build time.

4.  **GraphQL**: Goes hand-in-hand with Gatsby, passes data around the website.

5.  **NetlifyCMS**: A headless CMS for me to edit my website content easily.

6.  **Netlify Functions**: Netlify's way of using AWS Lambda functions for a bit of backend functionality.
